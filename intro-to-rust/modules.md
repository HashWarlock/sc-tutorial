### Modules, Crates, Packages & Paths Management
Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your codeâ€™s organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the module system, include:
- Packages: Cargo features for build, test & share crates
- Crates: A tree of modules that produces library or executable
- Modules and use: Control the organization, scope & privacy of path
- Paths: A naming for struct, function or module

#### Crates and Packages
- A `crate` is a binary or library. 
- The `crate root` is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate. 
- A `package` is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A package contains a Cargo.toml file that describes how to build those crates.

#### Modules
- A package is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A package contains a Cargo.toml file that describes how to build those crates.

Example from Rust Programming Language
```rust
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
```

#### Paths
When accessing a path there are 2 forms you'll likely encounter:
- `absolute path` starts from a crate root by using a crate name or a literal crate
- `relative path` starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current module

Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers separated by double colons (::)
